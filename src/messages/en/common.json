      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to use this free video converter?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Conversion happens 100% in your browser without uploading videos to external servers, so your files remain on your device."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does converting mkv to mp4 lose quality or subtitles?",
        "answer": "No. We use Stream Copy, so the mp4 file retains the original quality, audio tracks, and soft subtitles from the mkv."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a size limit when converting mkv to mp4?",
        "answer": "We recommend keeping each individual mkv file under 1.5GB. The process runs in memory, and if a video is very large, the browser may run out of resources. Split or compress the file with FFmpeg if it exceeds this size."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does mkv to mp4 online conversion take?",
        "answer": "It depends on file size. Since it's a local process, a 300‚Äì500MB mkv typically completes in seconds; one close to 1.5GB takes about a minute. Keep the tab active during conversion."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert multiple mkv files to mp4 at once?",
        "answer": "You can add up to 10 mkv files. The converter processes them one after another to avoid memory errors. If you need to free memory, download the mp4 files and refresh the page before starting another batch."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does converting mkv to mp4 re-encode the video?",
        "answer": "No. This process uses direct copy‚Äîit only changes the container from mkv to mp4 without recompressing the video or audio, making it fast and lossless."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I convert mkv to mp4 from my phone?",
        "answer": "Yes, the interface is responsive and works on mobile phones or tablets. For large mkv files (around 1.5GB), we recommend a desktop browser as it handles memory better."
